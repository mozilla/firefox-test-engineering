New Contributor Guide
=====================

First things first: Welcome to Mozilla! We're glad to have you here, whether
you're considering volunteering as a contributor or are employed by Mozilla.

Our goal here is to get you up and running to contribute as an
automation developer. This guide attempts to be generic enough to be
useful to most A-Team projects, but some details (especially around
software you need installed) may vary among projects.

Let's get started!
